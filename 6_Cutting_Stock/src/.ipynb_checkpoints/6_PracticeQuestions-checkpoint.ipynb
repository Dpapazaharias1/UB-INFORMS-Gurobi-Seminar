    "# Problem 1: Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The vehicle routing problem is an extension of the TSP with more vehicles and an explicit depot node where all tours must originate and terminate from. Capacitated vehicle routing problem refers to the fact that each vehicle hsa some capacity (weight, size, etc.) that cannot be exceeded by the customer demand that that vehicle serves.\n",

    "\n",
    "The arc-based formulation has issues with symmetry, co-optimal or alternataive solutions. It is an overall weaker formulation than the path-based alternative. Though the path-based formulation has its own issues. Namely, there are an exponential number of paths which can be generated and thus the LP will be too large to solve explicitly. We will utilize Column Generation in order to solve the linear programming relaxation of the CVRP\n",

    "## Path-Based Formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "For the sake of simplicity we will assume that we have a homogenous fleet of vehicles. The reason this formulation is referred to as a \"Path-Based\" formulation is that we create a dummy depot 0' (which is just a copy of depot 0) and find the set of feasible paths that go from 0 to 0'\n",

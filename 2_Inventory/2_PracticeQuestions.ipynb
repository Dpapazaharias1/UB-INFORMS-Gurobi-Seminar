    "\n",
    "We will now look at an instance of the drinking glass problem with a larger data set. We will also take a look at one Gurobi's objects, the multidict.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Multidict\n",
    "\n",
    "This function splits a single dictionary into multiple dictionaries. The input dictionary should map each key to a list of n values. The function returns a list of the shared keys as its first result, followed by the n individual Gurobi tuple dictionaries (stored as tupledict objects).\n",

    "### Arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "**data**: A Python dictionary. Each key should map to a list of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Return value\n",
    "\n",
    "A list, where the first member contains the shared key values, and the following members contain the dictionaries that result from splitting the value lists from the input dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "keys, dict1, dict2 = multidict( {\n",
    "    'key1': [1, 2],\n",
    "    'key2': [1, 3],\n",
    "    'key3': [1, 4] } )```\n",

    "```Python \n",
    "keys = ['key1', 'key2', 'key3']\n",
    "dict1 = {'key1':1, 'key2':1, 'key3':1}\n",
    "dict2 = {'key1':2, 'key2':3, 'key3':4}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Usally we use multidict to specify a set i.e Nodes and Arcs, and define all the parameters associate with that set all in one function\n",

With the standard 8x8 chessboard, it is possible to place 8 queens on the board such that no two queens threaten each other. In other words, no two queens can reach each other in one move. A solution for the 8x8 problem is shown below.\n",

    "# Problem 1: Max Flow Problem\n",

    "Maximum flow problems involve finding a feasible flow through a flow network that is maximum. The distinction is now the node supply/demand for sources and sinks is now a decision variable. Namely, we can push as must flow as we want out of the source so long as we are not violating the balance flow constraints or arc capacity. We will maximize the flow leaving $s$. \n",

That is, $s-t$ cut is a division of the vertices of the network into two parts, with the source in one part and the sink in the other.
